# Python to Java Compiler

This project is a Java to Python compiler that aims to translate Java code into equivalent Python code. The compiler is designed to handle different data types, classes, and functions in Java and generate corresponding Python code.


##Features

###Translation of Java Code: 
The compiler is capable of converting Java code to Python code, ensuring the functionality and logic of the original Java program are preserved in the translated Python code.

###Proficient Java to Python Compiler Developer: 
The project is led by an experienced developer who specializes in Java to Python compilation. The developer has a strong understanding of the entire compilation process, including tokenization, abstract syntax tree (AST) generation, type checking, intermediate representation (IR) generation, and Python code generation.
###Data Type Support: 
The compiler includes support for translating various Java data types to their corresponding Python equivalents. This ensures that the resulting Python code accurately represents the data types used in the original Java code.
###Optimization Techniques: 
The compiler implements optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and performance of the generated Python code. This helps to ensure that the translated code runs efficiently and effectively in the Python environment.
###Code Deletion Optimization: 
The project addresses a major difficulty in the compilation process by optimizing the code deletion process. This optimization streamlines the removal of unnecessary code during translation, resulting in cleaner and more concise Python code.

## Usage

There are two versions available for running the EmailValidator tool: an executable (.exe) version and a version designed for Google Colab. These versions have slightly different functionalities:

### Executable Version

There is a bash file named "sprint4.sh" in the sprint4 folder and please run the following command.

```python
$  bash sprint4.sh
```
